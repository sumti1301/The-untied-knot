<p style ="font-size:25px;text-align:center;line-height:30px; margin-bottom:20px;">They say life is all about finding happiness before we die. Some get happy seeing their loved ones, some get happy when they are winning, while some get happiness in the possibilities of future and then, there are few people who are happy for no reason, for whom happiness is not a goal to achieve but a feeling to find, an emotion which if tried can be found in anything and everything. Have you ever met such a person in your life? Well if you as me,  Honestly I like most of us haven’t. It’s tough to find such a person in world as much as it’s hard to become such kind of a person. At the end of the day we are all struggling and thriving for happiness love and satisfaction in our life’s.<br>The short stories of ‘The Untied Knots’ series is not about how to find happiness, love or satisfaction but it’s rather about what is happiness, love or satisfaction.<br>LET’S BEGIN</p>

<body style = "font-size:20px;">“Love….Love….Love….Love….Love….Love….Love….Love….Love….Love….Love….Love…”
  KESHAVI kept murmuring to herself, that’s when her flatmate Radhika came to her room to grab a few things. Keshavi asked Radhika “Radhika Have you ever been in love?” Radhika replied “ummm…not really love is not my cup of tea. Why do ask though?” Keshavi said “no reason, forget about it”. Without pestering her Radhika left the room after grabbing what is she came for. After she left Keshavi once again started he thought sprint. Ever since she came back from lunch with her boyfriend Rajat, she has been thinking about love. Well to be more clear she has been thinking about what Rajat said back at the college cafeteria. Rajat said “There are many things that you don’t deserve to know about my personal space”, in an angry tone. This was the reply she received when she asked him about him holding hands of another girl in their class. Sometimes one incident, one thing someone said can change the way you think about them or about that topic altogether. This reply changes her thought process entirely. She had thought of Rajat as the only one she could ever love and wanted to be with him for her entire life.<br>There are different types pf people we meet in our life on daily basis. Some come and go, some stay for a while and then there are some, you wish would stay with you  forever. For Keshavi, Rajat was someone she wished would have stayed with her forever. We usually stay unknown and think that our plans are just our imaginations, not reality. The reality which can be very different from our thoughts, something which we can’t even think of. The love she thought would stay with her entire life and with whom life would look easy was looking like a shackle now, which is emotionally very tough to For entire night she thought about it, and she remembered her mother narrating her stories of Srimati Radha rani and Lord Krishn’s eternal love. She as a 10-12 year old child never paid heed to it. She always thought how does these stories even relate to her. Her mother would tell her with a lot of love in her eyes, that in the love of Radha rani and Krishn ji there was no me and you. Love so divine that  Radha rani is Krishn ji and Krishn ji is Radha rani. For them every dust particle in the wind, every leaf of a tree, even the reflection of light was their loved one. In love their remains no difference between Radha rani and Krshn ji. If someone doesn’t praise Radha rani, can never appease Lord Krishn and if someone disrespects Lord Krishn, can never remain with Radha rani. The love in which one is lighten up by the just hearing the name of the loved one, the true eternal. The real knot of love which is looks untied and unbothered by anyone, yet is the strongest knot ever. <br> Her mother narrated “once Lord Krishn says to Radha rani, ‘ वृष भानु सुता राधे!!’ (Vrishbhanu’s daughter radhe) whenever I blink my eyes and look at you, each time you look more divine and graceful than before, the love for you in me increases and doubles each time I look at you.” <br> While recalling all these stories, which her mother told her, Keshavi felt as if somethings got clear in her mind. Just like when clouds get cleared in the sky and sun becomes visible, her decision was clearly visible to her. The very next day she broke up with Rajat and decided that she will never get into any relationship. <br> She then started to search and read more about the eternal love of Lord Krishn and Srimati Radha rani. While trying to comprehend their love, she realized that love is nothing but still everything. Love is ‘सत्-चित्-आनन्द’ (Sat`-chit`-Ananda). Sat means truth, the unchanging truth which is limitless and eternal, which goes beyond the human’s construct, time or space. The truth which is not forced, comes with chit` that is consciousness, understanding or awareness that flows through the knowledge of self and existence. The consciousness of love where the one you love is the only truth in the world. The consciousness which only has the name of the one you love, the thought of whose brings nothing but Ananda that is bliss and pure happiness, the boundless joy. To this love, oh lord, even if someone says the name of Radha rani, Krishn ji is blissed and if someone calls for Krishn ji Radha rani follows him.<br> No matter where Keshavi looked and tried to find, she couldn’t find a single person around her who loves their partner like this, where they themselves are nothing, everything is their loved one. After searching for many days, Keshavi realized that in this material world there is no one worth for this kind of love except god. <br> She had once met a saint while she was going to college from her flat. The saint was just chanting and dancing continuously. He kept chanting “Hare Krishn Hare Krishn Hare Hare Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare”, and dancing. She watched him for about 10 minutes from outside of the temple which comes in the way to her college and than left for her college. After attending 4 hours of lecture when she was returning, he was still there chanting and dancing tirelessly. She thought to herself at that time “why would someone so crazily chant and dance on god’s name?” The next day, while she was leaving for college she again saw that saint but this time he was talking to someone, she decided to go and ask him. She went up to him and asked him “I saw you yesterday dancing like crazy, you didn’t looked tired at all even after dancing so much to impress god? Does he not feel bad for making his devotee so tired and fatigued?” The saint smiled and answered “have you ever loved someone in your life? Love is the only feeling in this world which can never be make you feel tired, The only feeling that energizes you. I love god , I love him so much that I got happy because I have got a life where I can love him, I can take his name and get mesmerized and assured that he will never leave me alone even when I die, in fact I will get to meet him after my death. The dance was not to impress him but was the dance of joy, the joy of his love”. Keshavi did listened to him back then but couldn’t understand or relate to it, for she had never loved anyone which felt eternal.<br> Keshavi remembered that day and the saints words but now she understood his words way better and cleared her all doubts. And now when she hears the word love she can only think “Krishn…..Krishn…..Krishn……Krishn…..Krishn…..Krishn…..Krishn…Krishn.…Krishn…Krishn”.
